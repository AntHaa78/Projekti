# Projekti

Sulautetun ohjelmoinnin osaaja - Raspberry Pi projekti with motion sensors, simulate 3 different use of motion sensors:

Mode 1: Room booking
Library/office room booking simulation. Mini reservation system with user name/password/date, detect motion outside/inside, which direction, reservation cancelled if too long outside, etc.

Mode 2: Alarm System
If going on holidays/long period out of home and want to have an alarm. If motion detected, sends an alarm message and need a password to desactivate alarm.
